# Pizza-Sales-Performance-Analysis-Using-SQL-Power-BI
Analyzed pizza restaurant sales data using SQL &amp; BI dashboards to uncover trends in customer behavior, product performance, and revenue. Provided decision-ready insights to optimize menu, planning, and business decisions.

## **Project Summary**

This project analyzes the pizza restaurant’s sales data to understand customer ordering behavior, product performance, and overall business trends. Using SQL-based analysis, key KPIs such as total revenue, total orders, pizzas sold, average order value, and average pizzas per order were calculated to measure financial performance.

Daily and hourly order trends were visualized to identify peak demand periods, while category-wise and size-wise sales breakdowns revealed customer preferences. The project also highlights the top and bottom five pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and total orders to help the business optimize its menu and promotional strategy.

By converting raw sales data into actionable insights and clear visualizations, this project enables the restaurant to make informed, data-driven decisions that improve efficiency, reduce waste, and increase profitability.
